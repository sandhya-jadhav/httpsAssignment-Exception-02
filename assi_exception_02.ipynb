    "#### When creating a custom exception in Python, it's important to inherit from the Exception class, which is the base class for all built-in exceptions. This is because the Exception class provides the necessary structure and behavior for handling exceptions, allowing your custom exceptions to integrate seamlessly into Python's exception-handling framework. Reasons to Use the Exception Class:\n",
    "#### Consistent Behavior Across Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Exception class provides the standard behavior for exceptions, such as storing error messages, stack traces, and other relevant information. By inheriting from Exception, your custom exceptions automatically gain these features, ensuring consistent behavior with other built-in exceptions.\n",
    "#### Compatibility with try and except Blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python’s try and except blocks are designed to catch exceptions that inherit from the Exception class. By using Exception as the base class, your custom exceptions can be caught and handled just like any built-in exception, ensuring compatibility with Python’s error-handling mechanisms.\n",
    "#### Maintainability and Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheriting from the Exception class makes your custom exceptions more maintainable and readable. Other developers (or even yourself in the future) will immediately recognize your custom exceptions as legitimate Python exceptions, which enhances code clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "#### Enhanced Debugging and Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Exception class provides useful attributes such as args (a tuple of the exception's arguments) and __str__ (a method for returning the string representation of the exception). By inheriting from Exception, your custom exceptions will automatically have these attributes, which can be useful for debugging and logging errors.\n",
    "#### Integration with Built-in Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python provides various tools and libraries (e.g., logging, traceback) that work seamlessly with exceptions that inherit from the Exception class. By following this standard, your custom exceptions can be integrated into these tools without additional effort.\n",
